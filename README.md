# TRZY

This project was experimental and is no longer maintained as I have shifted focus on helping grow [Threlte](https://threlte.xyz).

Trzy is a vanilla Three.js utilities and extras library. It provides a collection of additional tools, objects, and effects for Three.js. It is inspired by React Three Fiber, Threlte, and Drei.
