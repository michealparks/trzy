### TRZY

Tools like [React Three Fiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/getting-started/introduction) and [Threlte](https://next.threlte.xyz/) have vastly reduced the overhead required for setting up a Three.js project. However, sometimes it makes sense to work within a strictly [vanilla.js](http://vanilla-js.com/) environment. 

Trzy aims to provide some of the features that you would come to expect with these tools if a sans-rendering-library experience is desired for a project. It contains helpers for setting up a Three.js scene, and additional classes that you would get with a tool like @react-three/drei.

> **Warning**
> Trzy is experimental, very early in development, and will likely contain breaking changes until 1.0.0
